# RentABikeHr

This is a Streamlit project that predicts the hourly demand for bike rentals. The project is based on a machine learning model that has been trained on historical bike rental data. It takes into account various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week to make accurate predictions.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
4. Run the Streamlit app by executing `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal.
5. The application should now be running on your local server. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

## Project Structure

The main files and directories in this project are as follows:

- `app.py`: This is the main Python file that contains the Streamlit application code.
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained machine learning model and any associated files.
- `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions used by the application.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can interact with it using the web interface. The interface allows you to input various features such as weather conditions, date, and time, and it will provide you with a predicted hourly demand for bike rentals.
